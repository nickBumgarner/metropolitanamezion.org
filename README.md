**Project Dependencies

To use this code base, you'll need the following installed:

- npm
- Gulp
- Browsersync
- Gulp Sass
- Node Bourbon
- NEAT


After cloning the repository run:

```bash
npm install
```

Assuming you've succesfully downloaded all project dependencies, you should be able to run:

```bash
gulp watch
```

This should compile your SCSS as well as open up Browsersync which allows the page to be auto-reloaded anytime there is a change to the code base.
